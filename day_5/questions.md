## Day 5 Questions

1. What is an Object, and how is it different from an Array in Javascript?
An Object stores information about a single item, where an array is a list of items.
Also Objects can store methods and functions within them, and arrays can only sotre data.

1. In the space below, create an Object stored to a variable named `petStore`.  This object should hold an inventory of items and the number of that item that you might find at a pet store.
petStore = {
  dog food: 45,
  cat food: 62,
  fish food: 3,
  cat toys: 19,
  dog toys: 12,
  bird food: 174,
};


1. Given the following `states = {"CO": "Colorado", "IA": "Iowa", "OK": "Oklahoma"}`, how would you access the value `"Iowa"`?
states.IA;

1. How would you add a new property to that object with a key of `"MN"` and a value of `"Minnesota"`?
states.MN = "Minnesota;"

1. What is another example of when we might use a object?  In this case, why is a object better than an array?
A song is a good example.
It had so much information such a artist, name, length, and genre. That a simple array can't include.

1. What questions do you still have about objects?
So far they make sense, and I am relived they exist. From here its just further implementation.
